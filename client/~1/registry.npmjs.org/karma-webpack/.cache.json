<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false }\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/)\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext)\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n|[**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`|\n|[**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false }\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/)\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext)\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n|[**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`|\n|[**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false }\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/)\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext)\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n|[**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`|\n|[**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false }\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/)\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext)\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n|[**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`|\n|[**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n\n    // add webpack to your list of frameworks\n    frameworks: ['mocha', 'webpack'],\n\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \".test.js\"\n      'test/**/*.test.js',\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // Do NOT specify the entry option\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Default webpack configuration\n\nThis configuration will be merged with what gets provided via karma's config.webpack.\n\n```js\nconst defaultWebpackOptions = {\n  mode: 'development',\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    path: path.join(os.tmpdir(), '_karma_webpack_'),\n  },\n  stats: {\n    modules: false,\n    colors: true,\n  },\n  watch: false,\n  optimization: {\n    runtimeChunk: 'single',\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n      minSize: 0,\n      cacheGroups: {\n        commons: {\n          name: 'commons',\n          chunks: 'initial',\n          minChunks: 1,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n  // Something like this will be auto added by this.configure()\n  // entry: {\n  //   'foo-one.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-one.test.js',\n  //   'foo-two.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-two.test.js',\n  // },\n  // plugins: [\n  //   new KarmaSyncPlugin()\n  // ],\n};\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThis project is a framework and preprocessor for Karma that combines test files and dependencies into 2 shared bundles and 1 chunk per test file. It relies on webpack to generate the bundles/chunks and to keep it updated during autoWatch=true.\n\nThe first preproccessor triggers the build of all the bundles/chunks and all following files just return the output of this one build process.\n\n### Webpack typescript support\n\nBy default karma-webpack forces *.js files so if you test *.ts files and use webpack to build typescript to javascript it works out of the box.\n\nIf you have a different need you can override by settig `webpack.transformPath`\n\n```js\n// this is the by default applied transformPath\nwebpack: {\n  transformPath: (filepath) => {\n      // force *.js files by default\n      const info = path.parse(filepath);\n      return `${path.join(info.dir, info.name)}.js`;\n    },\n},\n```\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n\n    // add webpack to your list of frameworks\n    frameworks: ['mocha', 'webpack'],\n\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \".test.js\"\n      // !!! use watched: false as we use webpacks watch\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*.test.js', watched: false }\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // Do NOT specify the entry option\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Default webpack configuration\n\nThis configuration will be merged with what gets provided via karma's config.webpack.\n\n```js\nconst defaultWebpackOptions = {\n  mode: 'development',\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    path: path.join(os.tmpdir(), '_karma_webpack_'),\n  },\n  stats: {\n    modules: false,\n    colors: true,\n  },\n  watch: false,\n  optimization: {\n    runtimeChunk: 'single',\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n      minSize: 0,\n      cacheGroups: {\n        commons: {\n          name: 'commons',\n          chunks: 'initial',\n          minChunks: 1,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n  // Something like this will be auto added by this.configure()\n  // entry: {\n  //   'foo-one.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-one.test.js',\n  //   'foo-two.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-two.test.js',\n  // },\n  // plugins: [\n  //   new KarmaSyncPlugin()\n  // ],\n};\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThis project is a framework and preprocessor for Karma that combines test files and dependencies into 2 shared bundles and 1 chunk per test file. It relies on webpack to generate the bundles/chunks and to keep it updated during autoWatch=true.\n\nThe first preproccessor triggers the build of all the bundles/chunks and all following files just return the output of this one build process.\n\n### Webpack typescript support\n\nBy default karma-webpack forces *.js files so if you test *.ts files and use webpack to build typescript to javascript it works out of the box.\n\nIf you have a different need you can override by settig `webpack.transformPath`\n\n```js\n// this is the by default applied transformPath\nwebpack: {\n  transformPath: (filepath) => {\n      // force *.js files by default\n      const info = path.parse(filepath);\n      return `${path.join(info.dir, info.name)}.js`;\n    },\n},\n```\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in

   { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false }\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only'\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context(\".\", true, /_test$/)\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext)\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n|[**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`|\n|[**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2

frameworks: ['mocha', 'webpack'],\n\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \".test.js\"\n      // !!! use watched: false as we use webpacks watch\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*.test.js', watched: false }\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // Do NOT specify the entry option\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Default webpack configuration\n\nThis configuration will be merged with what gets provided via karma's config.webpack.\n\n```js\nconst defaultWebpackOptions = {\n  mode: 'development',\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    path: path.join(os.tmpdir(), '_karma_webpack_'),\n  },\n  stats: {\n    modules: false,\n    colors: true,\n  },\n  watch: false,\n  optimization: {\n    runtimeChunk: 'single',\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n      minSize: 0,\n      cacheGroups: {\n        commons: {\n          name: 'commons',\n          chunks: 'initial',\n          minChunks: 1,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n  // Something like this will be auto added by this.configure()\n  // entry: {\n  //   'foo-one.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-one.test.js',\n  //   'foo-two.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-two.test.js',\n  // },\n  // plugins: [\n  //   new KarmaSyncPlugin()\n  // ],\n};\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThis project is a framework and preprocessor for Karma that combines test files and dependencies into 2 shared bundles and 1 chunk per test file. It relies on webpack to generate the bundles/chunks and to keep it updated during autoWatch=true.\n\nThe first preproccessor triggers the build of all the bundles/chunks and all following files just return the output of this one build process.\n\n### Webpack typescript support\n\nBy default karma-webpack forces *.js files so if you test *.ts files and use webpack to build typescript to javascript it works out of the box.\n\nIf you have a different need you can override by settig `webpack.transformPath`\n\n```js\n// this is the by default applied transformPath\nwebpack: {\n  transformPath: (filepath) => {\n      // force *.js files by default\n      const info = path.parse(filepath);\n      return `${path.join(info.dir, info.name)}.js`;\n    },\n},\n```\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in

<p>Use webpack to preprocess files in karma<p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-webpack\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n\n    // add webpack to your list of frameworks\n    frameworks: ['mocha', 'webpack'],\n\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \".test.js\"\n      // !!! use watched: false as we use webpacks watch\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*.test.js', watched: false }\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // Do NOT specify the entry option\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Default webpack configuration\n\nThis configuration will be merged with what gets provided via karma's config.webpack.\n\n```js\nconst defaultWebpackOptions = {\n  mode: 'development',\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    path: path.join(os.tmpdir(), '_karma_webpack_'),\n  },\n  stats: {\n    modules: false,\n    colors: true,\n  },\n  watch: false,\n  optimization: {\n    runtimeChunk: 'single',\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n      minSize: 0,\n      cacheGroups: {\n        commons: {\n          name: 'commons',\n          chunks: 'initial',\n          minChunks: 1,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n  // Something like this will be auto added by this.configure()\n  // entry: {\n  //   'foo-one.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-one.test.js',\n  //   'foo-two.test.js': 'path/to/test/foo-two.test.js',\n  // },\n  // plugins: [\n  //   new KarmaSyncPlugin()\n  // ],\n};\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThis project is a framework and preprocessor for Karma that combines test files and dependencies into 2 shared bundles and 1 chunk per test file. It relies on webpack to generate the bundles/chunks and to keep it updated during autoWatch=true.\n\nThe first preproccessor triggers the build of all the bundles/chunks and all following files just return the output of this one build process.\n\n### Webpack typescript support\n\nBy default karma-webpack forces *.js files so if you test *.ts files and use webpack to build typescript to javascript it works out of the box.\n\nIf you have a different need you can override by settig `webpack.transformPath`\n\n```js\n// this is the by default applied transformPath\nwebpack: {\n  transformPath: (filepath) => {\n      // force *.js files by default\n      const info = path.parse(filepath);\n      return `${path.join(info.dir, info.name)}.js`;\n    },\n},\n```\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map'\n}\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|[**`webpack`**](#webpack)|`{Object}`|`{}`|Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`|\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\"\n

karma-webpack\n\nUse webpack to preprocess files in karma.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo begin, you'll need to install `karma-webpack`:\n\n```console\nnpm i --save-dev karma-webpack\n```\n\nThen add config:\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = (config) => {\n  config.set({\n    // ... normal karma configuration\n    files: [\n      // all files ending in \"_test\"\n      { pattern: 'test/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      { pattern: 'test/**/*_test.js', watched: false },\n      // each file acts as entry point for the webpack configuration\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      // add webpack as preprocessor\n      'test/*_test.js': ['webpack'],\n      'test/**/*_test.js': ['webpack'],\n    },\n\n    webpack: {\n      // karma watches the test entry points\n      // (you don't need to specify the entry option)\n      // webpack watches dependencies\n      // webpack configuration\n    },\n\n    webpackMiddleware: {\n      // webpack-dev-middleware configuration\n      // i. e.\n      stats: 'errors-only',\n    },\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### `Alternative Usage`\n\nThis configuration is more performant, but you cannot run single test anymore (only the complete suite).\n\nThe above configuration generates a `webpack` bundle for each test. For many test cases this can result in many big files. The alternative configuration creates a single bundle with all test cases.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n\n```js\nfiles: [\n  // only specify one entry point\n  // and require all tests in there\n  'test/index_test.js'\n],\n\npreprocessors: {\n  // add webpack as preprocessor\n  'test/index_test.js': [ 'webpack' ]\n},\n```\n\n**test/index_test.js**\n\n```js\n// require all modules ending in \"_test\" from the\n// current directory and all subdirectories\nconst testsContext = require.context('.', true, /_test$/);\n\ntestsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext);\n```\n\nEvery test file is required using the [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) and compiled with webpack into one test bundle.\n\n### `Source Maps`\n\nYou can use the `karma-sourcemap-loader` to get the source maps generated for your test bundle.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D karma-sourcemap-loader\n```\n\nAnd then add it to your preprocessors.\n\n**karma.conf.js**\n\n```js\npreprocessors: {\n  'test/test_index.js': [ 'webpack', 'sourcemap' ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd tell `webpack` to generate sourcemaps.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n\n```js\nwebpack: {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map';\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThis is the full list of options you can specify in your `karma.conf.js`\n\n|                     Name                      |    Type    | Default | Description                                                                             |\n| :-------------------------------------------: | :--------: | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|           [**`webpack`**](#webpack)           | `{Object}` |  `{}`   | Pass `webpack.config.js` to `karma`                                                     |\n| [**`webpackMiddleware`**](#webpackmiddleware) | `{Object}` |  `{}`   | Pass `webpack-dev-middleware` configuration to `karma`                                  |\n|  [**`beforeMiddleware`**](#beforemiddleware)  | `{Object}` |  `{}`   | Pass custom middleware configuration to `karma`, **before** any `karma` middleware runs |\n\n### `webpack`\n\n`webpack` configuration (`webpack.config.js`).\n\n### `webpackMiddleware`\n\nConfiguration for `webpack-dev-middleware`.\n\n### `beforeMiddleware`\n\n`beforeMiddleware` is a `webpack` option that allows injecting middleware before\nkarma's own middleware runs. This loader provides a `webpackBlocker`\nmiddleware that will block tests from running until code recompiles. That is,\ngiven this scenario\n\n1. Have a browser open on the karma debug page (http://localhost:9876/debug.html)\n2. Make a code change\n3. Refresh\n\nWithout the `webpackBlocker` middleware karma will serve files from before\nthe code change. With the `webpackBlocker` middleware the loader will not serve\nthe files until the code has finished recompiling.\n\n> **⚠️ The `beforeMiddleware` option is only supported in `karma >= v1.0.0`**\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease take a moment to read our contributing guidelines if you haven't yet done so.\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/karma-webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/karma-webpack\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/karma-webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n[deps]: https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack\n[chat]: https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-webpack%2Fwebpack-brightgreen.svg\n[chat-url]: https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack\n[tests]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack-contrib.karma-webpack?branchName=master\n[tests-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master\n[cover]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n[cover-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack\n[chat]: https://badges.gitter.im/webpack/webpack.svg\n[chat-url]: https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack\n[size]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=css-loader\n[size-url]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=css-loader\n","maintainers":[{"email":"wiens.joshua@gmail.com","name":"d3viant0ne"},{"email":"eric@smarterspam.com","name":"ericclemmons"},{"email":"sheo13666q@gmail.com","name":"evilebottnawi"},{"email":"mail@johannesewald.de","name":"jhnns"},{"email":"foucault.matthieu@gmail.com","name":"matthieu-foucault"},{"email":"michael.ciniawsky@gmail.com","name":"michael-ciniawsky"},{"email":"ryan@ryanclark.me","name":"rynclark"},{"email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com","name":"sokra"},{"email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu","name":"thelarkinn"}],"time":{"modified":"2019-06-08T14:56:48.064Z","created":"2014-01-19T11:19:09.744Z","1.0.0":"2014-01-19T11:19:11.047Z","1.0.1":"2014-01-20T00:38:19.826Z","1.0.2":"2014-03-27T07:18:55.274Z","1.1.0":"2014-03-27T08:09:23.069Z","1.2.0":"2014-05-26T21:52:48.437Z","1.2.1":"2014-05-27T05:37:18.920Z","1.2.2":"2014-08-20T11:07:32.078Z","1.3.0":"2014-10-15T07:49:07.055Z","1.3.1":"2014-10-15T13:06:33.788Z","1.4.0":"2015-01-02T20:36:00.758Z","1.5.0":"2015-01-06T21:21:41.476Z","1.5.1":"2015-05-04T19:00:22.061Z","1.6.0":"2015-07-14T16:42:08.191Z","1.7.0":"2015-07-31T09:43:05.713Z","1.8.0":"2016-08-07T19:48:38.372Z","1.8.1":"2016-12-22T00:18:36.902Z","2.0.0":"2017-01-11T21:34:21.849Z","2.0.1":"2017-01-11T22:13:02.100Z","2.0.2":"2017-01-26T08:50:22.591Z","2.0.3":"2017-03-15T05:23:47.581Z","2.0.4":"2017-07-07T16:35:39.839Z","2.0.5":"2017-10-08T23:53:57.488Z","2.0.6":"2017-11-10T19:59:20.286Z","2.0.7":"2017-12-14T03:02:17.003Z","2.0.8":"2017-12-14T12:08:25.021Z","2.0.9":"2017-12-14T20:08:19.753Z","2.0.10":"2018-02-25T21:18:17.520Z","2.0.11":"2018-02-25T23:24:00.007Z","2.0.12":"2018-02-26T21:36:56.564Z","2.0.13":"2018-02-27T20:49:23.127Z","3.0.0":"2018-03-19T18:59:58.859Z","4.0.0-beta.0":"2018-03-19T19:29:08.641Z","3.0.1":"2018-09-01T04:23:52.451Z","4.0.0-rc.0":"2018-09-01T04:38:44.547Z","3.0.2":"2018-09-03T02:29:19.586Z","4.0.0-rc.1":"2018-09-03T02:37:53.724Z","3.0.3":"2018-09-07T12:02:12.507Z","3.0.4":"2018-09-07T15:03:21.243Z","4.0.0-rc.2":"2018-09-07T15:18:22.676Z","3.0.5":"2018-09-14T14:37:21.385Z","4.0.0-rc.3":"2018-11-20T19:03:41.035Z","4.0.0-rc.4":"2018-11-28T16:06:00.894Z","4.0.0-rc.5":"2018-11-30T18:13:14.157Z","5.0.0-alpha.0":"2018-12-13T03:55:41.919Z","5.0.0-alpha.1":"2019-01-01T21:12:04.675Z","4.0.0-rc.6":"2019-01-31T15:56:41.814Z","5.0.0-alpha.2":"2019-02-13T02:08:06.464Z","5.0.0-alpha.3.0":"2019-03-07T00:34:21.705Z","4.0.0":"2019-06-07T16:06:36.636Z","4.0.1":"2019-06-07T17:25:18.726Z","4.0.2":"2019-06-08T14:56:45.289Z"},"author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack/issues"},"license":"MIT","users":{"ridermansb":true,"nhz.io":true,"pillar0514":true,"thotk":true,"pstoeckle":true,"panos277":true,"andrej-k":true,"tiggem1993":true,"yeming":true,"fakefarm":true,"lomocc":true,"renishskills":true,"debashish":true},"keywords":["karma","karma-plugin","karma-preprocessor","karma-webpack","webpack"],"_etag":"W/\"df93e4d6bc5df6330a7efbe57309560e\"","_lastModified":"Sat, 08 Jun 2019 14:56:49 GMT"}
